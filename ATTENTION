WHAT IS NEEDED:

a new syntax for PARTIAL surface ports that acts as an INTERFACE

proposal:

	4,?,8

what it does:

	create a surface port named 4 on the surface of 8
	this port is incomplete since it has no other side

	when a port is created from the ohter side that is named 4 on this side,
	then actually this incomplete port is used as an other side

	that allows to connect incomplete ports before they are even created on
	the other side, and has plenty of adventages, like justifying how special
	ports can have an effect, and allows to import any program by simulating
	the special spaces around it, and allows for libraries to do cool stuff,
	etc.
